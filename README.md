> Cosmic voids are extremely vast areas in space which contain very few or no galaxies. In essence, those are the deserts of the universe.

Follow Feryuu, an android mercenary, on an escort mission gone wrong on a remote, uninhabited planet; and try to escape it alive!

Cosmic Void is a retro-style metroidvania with a modernized gameplay. It has a tense narrative closely tied with the planetâ€™s lore, and the main character is a no holds barred android mercenary, who has to make a choice between satisfying her curiosity or prioritizing survival.
